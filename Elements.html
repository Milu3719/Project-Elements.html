<body><h1>Cricket</h1>
<p>Cricket is a <b>bat-and-ball game</b> that is played between <i>two teams of eleven players on a field, </i>at the centre of which is
a 22-yard (20-metre; 66-foot) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. Two
players from the batting team (the striker and nonstriker) stand in front of either wicket holding bats, with one player
from the fielding team (the bowler) bowling the ball towards the striker's wicket from the opposite end of the pitch.
The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting
<strong>team scoring one run for each exchange.</strong> Runs are also scored when the <em>ball reaches or crosses the boundary of the field</em>
or when the ball is <small>bowled illegally</small></p>

<q>Traditionally, cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket, they wear club or team colours. In
addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard,
solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly
wound string.</q>
